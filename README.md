# find-a-gamer
This project shall help to find a person to play games with. We call this a 'gaming buddy'.
The idea can be found [here](https://github.com/Grimmig18/find-a-gamer/blob/master/Planning/planning01.md#meeting-notes-from-06032020) in our meeting notes.
The project shall be implemented in TypeScript using [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) for the backend and the [Angular framework](https://angular.io/) for the frontend.
